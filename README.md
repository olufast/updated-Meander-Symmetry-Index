# updated-Meander-Symmetry-Index
Python workflow to compute the Meander Symmetry Index (Ïƒ) of river bends from centerline shapefiles. Supports visual segmentation with meanderlimits/apex points and automatic curvature-based detection (Finotello et al. 2024). Outputs CSV, GeoPackage, and plots for adjacent and long-term year pairs.
